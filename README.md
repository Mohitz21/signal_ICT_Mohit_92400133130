Signal Processing Package for ICT Course
This Python package, signal_ICT_StudentName_EnrollmentNo, provides a collection of modules for generating and manipulating various types of signals commonly studied in signal processing. It includes:

Unitary Signals: Unit step, unit impulse, ramp signals, etc.
Trigonometric Signals: Sine wave, cosine wave, exponential signals.
Signal Operations: Time shifting, time scaling, addition, multiplication, and other basic signal operations.
The package is designed as part of the ICT course project to demonstrate practical implementation of signal generation and operations using Python. It leverages popular libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib for numerical computations and visualization.

Features
Easy-to-use functions for generating standard signals.
Functions to perform common signal transformations.
Visualization support for plotting signals.
Modular design for easy extension and reuse.
